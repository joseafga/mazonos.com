# Mazon OS - Static site generator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/joseafga/mazonos.com.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/joseafga/mazonos.com)

The mazonos.com is a static site and here we have the code used to generate it.

*Read this in another language: [English](README.md), [PortuguÃªs (BR)](README.pt-BR.md).*

## Usage
The generator use Node.js to build the pages and npm as package manager.

### Instructions
Download the repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/joseafga/mazonos.com.git

Access the folder and run the installation of the dependencies:

    $ cd mazonos.com
    $ npm install

Run the script to generate the static site:

    $ npm run build

Done! Just wait for the process to complete and a new folder named as `build` will appear, inside it are the files that were generated.

## Translate
Help us to translate the site!

To facilitate translation popular and easy-to-read formats were used, these being *markdown* and *yaml*. Inside `src/content/` are found the folders corresponding to each available language. Each language has a file named `data.yml` it contains the data shared between all pages of the site, another `.md` files match the pages themselves.  
To add a new language just copy the folder with the reference language (of your preference) and then edit the files of your content.
